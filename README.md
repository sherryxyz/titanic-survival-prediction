## Titanic Survival Classification using PySpark

### Introduction
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using PySpark. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset available on Kaggle. PySpark and the pyspark.ml library are used for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

### Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including attributes like age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not. The goal is to build a machine-learning model that can predict whether a passenger survived or perished based on these features.

### Models Explored
The following machine learning models were explored for predicting Titanic survival:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
